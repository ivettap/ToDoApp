Description
This console application is a simple To-Do list manager where users can view, create, complete, and delete tasks organized by categories. It is developed as a practical example of a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using C# and Entity Framework Core with a SQL Server database.

The project follows a clean object-oriented structure and uses a layered architecture (UI, Logic, Data, Models, and Migrations) to separate concerns.
